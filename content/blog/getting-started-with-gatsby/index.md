In this post, I'll share my experience getting started with Gatsby and how I built this blog.

## What is Gatsby?

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a free and open-source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing-fast websites and apps. It uses modern web technologies like React, GraphQL, and webpack to create optimized websites.

## Why I Chose Gatsby

There are several reasons why I chose Gatsby for my blog:

1. **Speed**: Gatsby generates static files which load extremely fast
2. **React-based**: Since I already know some React, Gatsby was a natural choice
3. **Great Plugin Ecosystem**: There are plugins for almost everything
4. **SEO-friendly**: Gatsby sites perform well in search engines

## Basic Structure of a Gatsby Site

A basic Gatsby site includes:

- `src/pages`: React components that become pages automatically
- `gatsby-config.js`: Site configuration options
- `gatsby-node.js`: Implement Gatsby's Node.js API to customize the build process

```javascript
// Example of a simple Gatsby page component
import React from "react";

const IndexPage = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to my Gatsby site!</h1>
      <p>This is a simple example of a Gatsby page component.</p>
    </main>
  );
};

export default IndexPage;
```

I'm looking forward to exploring more Gatsby features as I continue to develop this blog!
